#Tuple practice

#tuple is datastructure where we can store multiple pieces of information
#key differences from lists are: lists aren't immutable, tuples are for
#data that won't ever change. You can put tuples inside a list.
# tuples are immutable, can't modify it later on in the program

#index value still starts at 0, so 4=0, 5=1 in this example
coordinates = (4, 5)

print(coordinates[1])
